# project-boilerplate
Boilerplate for starting a new project

## About
Used as a starting point for most projects, ready with a Gulp file, a SCSS file structure, and a simple JavaScript structure for smaller projects. It speeds up the initial development process and uses a structure/architecture that's been researched and adapated many times. It's been used and tested on small and large projects.

## Structure
All working files are in assets/assets-src
All built files are in assets/assets-built (compiled by Gulp)
